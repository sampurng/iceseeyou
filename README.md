## ICEseeyou
**Project Overview:**

ICEseeyou is a real-time, crowdsourced web application that allows users to track and report ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) activity. The platform integrates user-submitted reports, AI-driven credibility scoring, and a heatmap to visualize ICE activity trends. It also includes a legal chatbot to assist users with immigration-related inquiries. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
